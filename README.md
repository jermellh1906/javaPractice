# javaPractice
I haven't used Java in a while, so I am working through a few ecercises to sharpen up a little.  I have run into an issue I hope you brothers can help me debug.  In this exercise I am working with ArrayLists.  The printWords method is supposed to print out each word in a list that has exact number of letters provided by user.  I have found that if the user specifies five (5) for the variable letterCount, the method doesn't print out "house" and "mouse" for some reason.  If you can help me out, please do.
